# Python Projects and Exercises for AI/ML at eForum

Welcome to the eForum AI/ML Python repository! This README provides an overview of the projects and exercises covered in our course. Feel free to explore and contribute.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Object Creation and List Usage

Learn how to create Python objects and effectively use lists. We cover topics such as:

- Creating custom classes and objects.
- Manipulating lists (adding, removing, iterating, etc.).

### 2. File Encryption with JSON and Pickle

Discover how to secure your data using JSON and Pickle:

- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):**
  - Serialize structured data (dictionaries, lists) to a human-readable format.
  - Deserialize data from JSON files.
  - Useful for data exchange between different applications and languages.
  
- **Pickle:**
  - Serialize complex Python objects (including custom classes) to binary format.
  - Deserialize objects from Pickle files.
  - Useful for persistence across sessions or caching.

### 3. Machine Learning Training with Statistical Libraries

Learn how to perform machine learning tasks using statistical libraries like scikit-learn:

- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features.
- Training and evaluating machine learning models: regression, classification, clustering.
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning.

### 4. Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

Explore data visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn:

- Creating various types of plots: line plots, scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, etc.
- Customizing plot appearance: colors, labels, titles, legends, etc.
- Visualizing relationships and patterns in data.

### 5. Neural Networks Training

Understand the basics of neural networks and learn how to train them using PyTorch:

- Building neural network architectures: defining layers, activation functions, and loss functions.
- Training neural networks: optimization algorithms, backpropagation, gradient descent.
- Evaluating neural network performance: accuracy, loss, confusion matrix.
